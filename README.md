# Book-Cover-Via-Vocabulary-Tree
A project that uses a vocabulary tree approach to identify book covers from oblique images. It employs SIFT for feature extraction and a hierarchical vocabulary tree, built using hierarchical k-means clustering, for scalable and efficient recognition from a database of 100 book cover images.
